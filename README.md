# Outfit-Generator

A project for Introduction to Computer Science II

This is a randomized outfit generator. 

The instructions were to create a wardrobe class, with appropriate subclasses, and demonstrate knowledge of class design,
inheritance, and polymorphism. 

The wardrobe generator must take all items in the wardrobe, generate a random outfit, and use rules to decide whether the 
outfit is 'stylish'.
